# Classic-Harmonic-Oscillator-Simulation

All the examples are harmonic oscillators in the case of a spring, but they can be modified very easily to represent RLC circuits, Pendulums, etc. 

A Python program showcasing the main types of harmonic oscillators. The simulation is interactive and allows configurable parameters. 
The raw code and Jupyter Notebook files are provided.
